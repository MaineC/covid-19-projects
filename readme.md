# COVID-19 Related Projects

Following on from [this blog post](https://github.blog/2020-03-23-open-collaboration-on-covid-19/), creating a list to keep track of projects. Tag your GitHub repo with the 'covid-19' topic to get it to show up in [the covid-19 topic on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/covid-19)  Also check out the list '[Open Source COVID-19](https://github.com/WeileiZeng/Open-Source-COVID-19)'

**UPDATE:** Rather than tracking here, let's standardize on this as the awesomelist: https://github.com/soroushchehresa/awesome-coronavirus
